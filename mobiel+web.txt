🔁 Compare: What’s on Your Laptop vs. Jenkins Machine
Component			On Your Laptop	On Jenkins Machine (Needs to Be)
Java				✅		✅
Maven				✅		✅
Appium installed		✅		⚠️ Might be missing
Node.js installed		✅		⚠️ Might be missing
Android SDK			✅		⚠️ Might be missing
Connected device/emulator	✅		⚠️ Might be missing

============================================================================
✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Run in Jenkins
✅ Step 1: Install Prerequisites on Jenkins Server
Log in to your Jenkins server (or agent where tests will run), and install the following:

bash

# Install Node.js (needed for Appium)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm

# Install Appium
npm install -g appium

# Install Java (if not already)
sudo apt install default-jdk

# Install Android SDK (can use Android Studio or sdkmanager)
Then add environment variables:


bash

export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
✅ Step 2: Connect Device or Set Up Emulator
You can connect a real Android phone via USB, or

Use an Android emulator with:

bash

emulator -avd <emulator_name>
Use adb devices to confirm it's connected.

✅ Step 3: Configure Jenkins Job
Assuming you're using a Freestyle Job, do the following:

💡 In Jenkins → Job → Configure:
🛠 Add Build Step → Execute Shell
Paste this:

bash

#!/bin/bash

echo "Running Mobile Tests in Jenkins"

# Start Appium in background
appium --log-level info &

# Wait for Appium to start
sleep 10

# (Optional) Start emulator if needed
# emulator -avd <Your_Emulator_Name> &

# Wait for device to be ready
adb wait-for-device

# Run Maven mobile tests
mvn clean test -Pmobile
🔁 This is the same as what you're doing on your laptop — just automated inside Jenkins.

✅ Step 4: Make Sure Jenkins Has Permissions
Jenkins must run with a user that can access:

Android SDK

Appium

adb

You might need to set environment variables in ~/.bashrc or globally for Jenkins.

🔍 How to Test It’s Working
Go to Jenkins → Your Job → Build Now

Jenkins console output should show:

Appium server starting

Device detected

Maven running the mobile TestNG suite

❗ If It Fails
Common issues and fixes:

Problem	Fix
adb not found	Set ANDROID_HOME and add to PATH
Appium not recognized	Install Appium with npm install -g appium
Device not detected	Use adb devices to confirm device is connected
Appium server not running	Ensure appium & runs before mvn test
Emulator not starting	Install emulator, create AVD, and start it in the script

✅ Summary
You’ve already built and tested mobile automation on your laptop. Now in Jenkins:

Make sure Jenkins machine has the same tools.

Add a shell step in your Jenkins job to:

Start Appium

Wait for the device

Run your mobile tests using Maven (mvn clean test -Pmobile)
